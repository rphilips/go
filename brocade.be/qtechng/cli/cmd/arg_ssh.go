var argSSHCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "ssh",
	Short: "Start qtechng with arguments retrieved by SSH",
	Long: `Launches qtechng with the arguments retrieved by SSH.

The argument is a full path to a file on the development server.
This file is retrieved and the arguments are extracted.

If the first non-whitespace character in the file is a *[*, the contents should be a *JSON array*.

If the file is *NOT* a JSON array, the following restrictions apply:
    - The first line should always be *qtechng*
    - Arguments are read line-by-line from the named file
    - Whitespace is stripped at the beginning and the end of each line
    - Empty lines are skipped
    - The first line should be *qtechng*

If the file *IS* a JSON array, the following applies:
    - The first element should always be *qtechng*
    - Whitespace is never stripped
    - Empty arguments remain in the argument list
